The worker's wage and all other dues shall be paid in the local currency in accordance with the following:\na) Workers paid on a daily basis shall be paid at least once a week.\nb) Workers paid on a monthly basis shall be paid once a month.\nc) If the work is done by piece and requires a period of more than two weeks, the worker shall receive a payment each\nweek commensurate with the completed portion of the work. The balance of the wage shall be paid in full during the week following delivery of the work.\nd) In cases other than the above, worker's wages shall be paid at least once a week.\n2. Firms shall be required to deposit workers' wages into their bank accounts through approved banks in the Kingdom, provided that their due date does not exceed the deadlines referred to above. The Minister may exempt some firms from such requirement.\n### Article 91\n1. If a worker, as a result of his own fault or his violation of the employer's instructions and not as a result of a third party's fault or a force majeure, causes loss, damage, or destruction to machinery or products owned by the employer while in his custody, the employer may deduct from the worker's wage the amount necessary for repair or restoration to the original condition, provided that such deductions do not exceed an amount equivalent to five-day wage per month. The employer may file a grievance, if necessary, demanding more deductions if the worker has other properties from which collections may be made. The worker may file a grievance with the labor court regarding the allegations leveled at him or the employer's estimation of the damages. If the labor court rules that the employer is not entitled to claim such deductions or if it awards the employer a lower amount, the employer shall return to the worker the amounts unjustifiably deducted, within seven days from the date of the award.\n2. Either party shall file its grievance within 15 work days; otherwise, their right to do so shall be forfeited. For the employer, the date of filing the grievance shall be from the date the incident is discovered, and for the worker, from the date of his notification of the same by the employer.\n### Article 92\nNo amount shall be deducted from a worker's wages against private rights without his written consent, except in the following cases:\n1. Repayment of loans extended by the employer, provided that such deductions do not exceed 10% of his wage.\n2. Social insurance or any other contributions due on workers as provided for by law.\n3.

In the latter case, the worker may not be given more than three quarters of his wage.\n### Article 94\n1. If any amount is deducted from a worker's wages for reasons other than those specified in this Law without his written consent, or if an employer delays, without a valid justification, payment of a worker's wage beyond the due date set forth in the Law, the worker, his representative, or the head of the competent labor office may submit a request to the labor court to order the employer to return to the worker any wrongfully-deducted amount or to pay him his outstanding wages.\n2.

If the employment contract or the work organization regulation does not provide for the wage binding on the employer, the wage estimated for the same type of work in the firm, if any, shall be adopted; otherwise, the wage shall be estimated in accordance with the norms of the profession at the place where the work is performed. In the absence of such norms, the labor court shall estimate the wage in accordance with the dictates of justice.\n2. The same shall also apply in determining the type and scope of the service that the worker is required to render.\n### Article 96\n1. If the worker's wage is determined on the basis of piecework or productivity, the average wage which the worker receives for his actual work days during the last year of his service shall be used as the basis for calculating any entitlements determined for the worker under this Law.\n2. If the entire wage is the amounts received as commissions, percentages of sales, or the like which are by nature subject to increases or decreases, the daily average wage shall be calculated on the basis of the amounts the worker receives for the actual work days, divided by them.\n### Article 97\nIf a worker is detained or taken into custody by the competent authorities in cases related to work or occasioned by it, the employer shall continue to pay the worker 50% of the wage until the case is decided, provided that the period of detention or custody shall not exceed 180 days. If said period exceeds that, the employer shall not be required to pay any portion of the wage for the excess period.

In calculating consolidated weekly rest periods, it shall be taken into consideration that said periods begin at the hour the workers arrive at the nearest city with transportation services and end at the hour the workers return to it.\n### Article 106\nAn employer may not comply with the provisions of Articles 98, 101, and 104 (1) of this Law, in the following cases:\n1.

The employer shall pay the worker for overtime working hours an additional amount equal to the hourly wage plus 50% of his basic wage.\n2. If the firm is operated on the basis of weekly working hours, the hours in excess of the hours taken as the criterion shall be deemed overtime hours.\n3. All working hours performed during holidays and Eids shall be deemed overtime hours.\n## Article 108\nThe provisions of Articles 98 and 101 of this Law shall not apply to the following cases:\n1. Persons occupying high positions of authority in management and policy, if such positions grant the persons occupying them authority over workers.\n2. Preparatory or supplementary work which must be completed before the commencement or after the end of work.\n3. Work that is intermittent by necessity.\n4.
