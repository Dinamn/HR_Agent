      "question": "What is the minimum percentage of Saudi workers an employer must employ?",
      "rag_answer": "According to the Saudi Labor Law and related regulations, the required percentage of Saudi workers (Saudization or Nitaqat) varies depending on the company\u2019s sector, size, and activity. The law mandates that employers must comply with the Saudization program, which sets specific quotas for Saudi nationals in the workforce. These quotas are periodically updated by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD).  \n\nTo determine the exact percentage applicable to a specific company, you should refer to the latest Nitaqat classification published by the MHRSD for your industry and company size.",

          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer step by step based on the provided criteria. First, I am checking for factual accuracy relative to the ground truth answer, which states that the minimum percentage of Saudi workers an employer must employ is 75% of the total number of workers. The student's answer, however, does not mention this specific percentage. Instead, it discusses the Saudization program and Nitaqat classification, stating that the required percentage varies depending on the company's sector, size, and activity, and that specific quotas are set by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD). This indicates that the student\u2019s answer does not confirm or align with the specific 75% figure provided in the ground truth.\n\nSecond, I am checking if the student\u2019s answer contains any conflicting statements. The answer does not explicitly contradict the ground truth, as it does not provide a different percentage or deny the existence of a minimum percentage. However, by failing to mention the specific 75% and instead suggesting that the percentage varies and must be checked with the MHRSD, it implies that there is no fixed minimum percentage, which could be seen as inconsistent with the ground truth\u2019s definitive 75%.\n\nThird, while the criteria allow for additional information as long as it is factually accurate, the additional context provided by the student about varying percentages and the need to refer to MHRSD classifications does not support or align with the ground truth\u2019s specific percentage. The extra information, while potentially correct in a broader context, does not address the specific minimum percentage stated in the ground truth, which is the focus of the question.\n\nBased on this analysis, the student\u2019s answer does not meet the criteria for factual accuracy relative to the ground truth because it fails to acknowledge the specific 75% minimum percentage. Therefore, the answer cannot be considered correct under the given grading criteria."

          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer based on the given criteria. Step 1: Assess conciseness and relevance to the question. The question asks for the minimum percentage of Saudi workers an employer must employ. The student's answer discusses the Saudization program (Nitaqat) and mentions that the percentage varies depending on factors like sector, size, and activity of the company. While this provides context, it does not directly state a specific minimum percentage or a clear baseline, which is what the question seeks. Instead, it suggests referring to the Ministry for the exact percentage, which adds unnecessary length and avoids a direct answer.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate if the answer helps to address the question. The answer provides relevant background about the Saudization program and the role of the Ministry in setting quotas. However, it fails to give a concrete figure or even a general range for the minimum percentage, which is the core of the question. The suggestion to check with the MHRSD, while practical, does not fulfill the expectation of providing a direct or approximate answer.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion based on criteria. The answer is not concise as it includes additional details that do not directly answer the question. It is somewhat relevant in providing context about the Saudization program, but it does not meet the criteria of directly helping to answer the specific question about the minimum percentage. Therefore, the answer does not fully meet the criteria for relevance."

First, I am checking the factual accuracy of the student's answer relative to the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that the probation period can last a maximum of 90 days, extendable by written agreement up to 180 days. The student's answer aligns with this, stating that the probation period may not exceed 90 days but can be extended to a maximum of 180 days with written agreement between the employer and worker. This matches the ground truth perfectly in terms of the duration and the condition for extension.\n\nNext, I am checking for any conflicting statements within the student's answer. The student's response is consistent, with no contradictions. The statement about the extension being contingent on written agreement is clear and does not conflict with the initial statement about the 90-day maximum.\n\nFinally, I am considering whether the additional information provided by the student affects the correctness. The student mentions that official holidays and sick leaves are not counted within the probation period. While this detail is not included in the ground truth answer, the grading criteria allow for additional information as long as it does not conflict with the ground truth. Since the ground truth does not address holidays or sick leaves, and the student's core answer regarding the duration of the probation period remains accurate, this additional information does not impact the factual accuracy relative to the ground truth.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer meets all the criteria: it is factually accurate relative to the ground truth, contains no conflicting statements, and the extra information does not detract from its correctness."

The student's answer also describes 'continuous service' as an uninterrupted period of employment with the same employer, including official breaks such as annual leave, sick leave, or other authorized absences that do not terminate the employment relationship. While the student does not mention the specific limit of unpaid absences (not exceeding 20 days per year) or exam leaves as in the ground truth, the general description of uninterrupted service and inclusion of authorized absences aligns with the core concept of the ground truth.

In the student's answer, it is mentioned that after 'ten years or more', the worker receives the full award. This part of the student's answer aligns with the ground truth.\n\n2. **Additional Information**: The student provides extra details about partial awards for service durations of two to five years (one-third of the award) and five to ten years (two-thirds of the award). According to the grading criteria, additional information is acceptable as long as it does not conflict with the ground truth. However, we must check if this additional information introduces any inaccuracies or conflicts.\n\n3. **Conflict Check**: The student also states that a resigning worker becomes entitled to the full end-of-service award after completing five years of continuous service in the initial part of their answer. This directly contradicts the ground truth, which specifies 10 years or more for the full award. This is a factual inaccuracy and a conflicting statement within the student's answer.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Although part of the student's answer correctly states that the full award is given after ten years or more, the initial statement claiming the full award after five years is incorrect and conflicts with both the ground truth and the later part of their own response. As per the grading criteria, the presence of conflicting statements and factual inaccuracy means the answer does not meet the required standards.\n\nTherefore, the student's answer is deemed incorrect due to the conflicting and factually inaccurate statement regarding entitlement to the full award after five years."

          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer based on the given criteria. Step 1: Check if the answer is concise and relevant to the question. The question asks specifically about the number of years of service after which a resigning worker receives the full end-of-service award. The student\u2019s answer starts by stating that a worker is entitled to the full award after completing five years of continuous service, which directly addresses the question. However, the answer also includes additional information about partial awards for service between two and five years, and between five and ten years, before reiterating that the full award is given after ten years or more. This creates confusion because the initial statement (full award after five years) contradicts the later statement (full award after ten years). Despite this, the core of the question is addressed with the mention of service duration for the full award, though the inconsistency reduces clarity. Step 2: Check if the answer helps to answer the question. The answer does provide relevant information by specifying years of service tied to the full award, but the conflicting details (five years vs. ten years) may mislead or confuse. While the answer is relevant in intent, the additional and contradictory information slightly detracts from its focus. However, since the question is specifically about the full award and the student does provide an answer to that, I will consider it relevant, acknowledging that the inconsistency is a minor issue in terms of relevance but could affect accuracy (which is not part of the criteria). Therefore, based on the criteria of conciseness and relevance to the question, I conclude that the answer meets the requirements, though it could be improved by removing contradictory details."

The student's answer states that a part-time worker is an employee whose working hours are less than the standard full-time hours for similar jobs within the establishment. While the student's answer does not explicitly mention 'half' the usual hours, the concept of working less than full-time hours aligns with the general idea of part-time work as described in the ground truth. However, the ground truth is more specific, indicating 'less than half,' which may imply a stricter threshold than just 'less than standard full-time hours.' This introduces a potential discrepancy in precision, as 'less than full-time' could theoretically include hours just below full-time, which might not be less than half.\n\nNext, I am checking for any conflicting statements in the student's answer.

The student provides a clear statement about the legal protection against termination during pregnancy, including exceptions permitted by law, which directly answers the question posed. The mention of job security further reinforces the relevance to the topic of termination during pregnancy. Therefore, the answer meets all the criteria for relevance.

The ground truth states that the minimum age for employment is 15 years, with exceptions for light work between 13-15 years under specific conditions. The student's answer correctly states that the minimum age for employment is 15 years, which aligns with the ground truth. Second, I am checking if the student answer contains any conflicting statements. The student mentions additional information about restrictions for those under 18 years, such as prohibitions on hazardous work and night shifts. This additional information does not conflict with the ground truth, as it does not contradict the minimum age of 15 years or the exceptions for 13-15 years. Third, per the criteria, it is acceptable for the student to provide more information as long as it is factually accurate relative to the ground truth. While the ground truth does not mention restrictions for under 18 years, the student's additional information does not negate or conflict with the core fact of the minimum age being 15 years. Since the question focuses on the minimum age for employment, and the student has answered that correctly, the additional details do not impact the factual accuracy of the core answer. Therefore, there are no conflicting statements or inaccuracies relative to the ground truth. Based on this analysis, the student's answer meets all the criteria for correctness."

The student's answer includes similar points: entering workplaces (though it specifies 'during working hours' which introduces a slight deviation from 'anytime without notice'), reviewing records and documents, questioning employers and employees, and taking samples or evidence. The core powers mentioned in the ground truth are covered in the student's answer, though the condition of 'during working hours' slightly conflicts with the ground truth's 'anytime without notice.'\n\n2. **No Conflicting Statements**: Within the student's answer itself, there are no internal contradictions or conflicting statements. However, the specification of 'during working hours' conflicts with the ground truth's implication of unrestricted access 'anytime without notice.' This is a factual inaccuracy relative to the ground truth.\n\n3. **Additional Information**: The student's answer includes extra details such as 'issue violation reports and recommend penalties for non-compliance' and the context of Saudi Labor Law. As per the criteria, additional information is acceptable as long as it does not conflict with the ground truth. While the additional information about issuing reports and penalties is not mentioned in the ground truth, it does not directly contradict it. However, the conflict arises from the restriction on timing of access, as mentioned earlier.\n\n**Conclusion**: Due to the discrepancy regarding the timing of access ('during working hours' vs. 'anytime without notice'), the student's answer is factually inaccurate relative to the ground truth. This deviation violates the criteria for correctness. Therefore, the answer cannot be considered fully correct.\n"

The student's answer mentions that such reassignment is allowed 'only in cases of necessity' and 'for a temporary period.'

The student's answer includes: employer's family members, domestic workers, sports players and coaches, sea workers (specified as those on ships under 500 tons), and agricultural workers (with some exceptions).

The details provided (e.g., ships under 500 tons for sea workers and exceptions for agricultural workers) are consistent with the ground truth's mention of 'certain sea workers' and 'agricultural workers,' as these imply specific conditions.\n\n2. **No Conflicting Statements**: The student's answer does not contain any statements that conflict with the ground truth. All the categories mentioned align with the ground truth, and the additional details provided (e.g., reference to Article 7 of the Saudi Labor Law) do not contradict the ground truth.

While it omits one category (short-term non-Saudi workers), the criteria focus on the accuracy of what is provided rather than completeness unless explicitly stated.

          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer step by step based on the provided criteria.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy Relative to Ground Truth**: The ground truth answer states that a non-competition clause can be valid for a maximum of two years from the termination date. The student's answer also states that the duration of such a clause must not exceed '\u0633\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629' which translates to 'two years from the date of termination of the employment relationship.' This matches the ground truth answer in terms of the time limit and the reference point (termination date).\n\n2. **No Conflicting Statements**: The student's answer does not contain any statements that conflict with the ground truth. It consistently supports the maximum duration of two years and does not suggest any alternative or contradictory timeframes.\n\n3. **Additional Information**: The student provides extra context about the non-competition clause needing to be specific in terms of duration, location, and type of work, and mentions that any clause exceeding the two-year limit is considered void. While this information is not part of the ground truth answer, it does not contradict it. As per the grading criteria, additional information is acceptable as long as it is factually accurate relative to the ground truth. Since the core fact about the duration aligns with the ground truth, this additional information does not affect the correctness negatively.\n\n**Conclusion**: The student's answer is factually accurate with respect to the ground truth, contains no conflicting statements, and the additional information provided does not detract from the correctness of the core answer. Therefore, the answer meets all the criteria for correctness."

          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer based on the given criteria. Step 1: Check if the answer is concise and relevant to the question. The question asks specifically about the duration a non-competition clause can be valid after employment ends. The student's answer directly addresses this by stating that, according to Saudi labor law, the duration of a non-competition clause must not exceed two years from the end of the employment relationship. The answer also mentions that any clause exceeding this duration is considered invalid, which further clarifies the point. Additionally, while the student includes context about the clause needing to be specific in terms of duration, location, and type of work, this does not detract from the conciseness as it provides necessary legal context without unnecessary elaboration. Step 2: Check if the answer helps to answer the question. The student's response explicitly provides the time limit of two years, which is the core of the question, and reinforces it by explaining the consequence of exceeding this limit. Therefore, the answer meets both criteria of being concise and relevant, as well as directly helping to answer the question. Based on this reasoning, the answer is relevant."

      "question": "What nursing break time are female workers entitled to?",
      "rag_answer": "According to the Saudi Labor Law, a female worker who is nursing her child is entitled to one or more daily breaks for breastfeeding, in addition to the regular rest periods. These nursing breaks are counted as part of the working hours and do not result in any reduction in wages.",
      "ground_truth": "One hour per day total, counted as working hours with no wage reduction",
      "evaluations": {
        "correctness": {
          "score": true,
          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer step by step based on the provided criteria. First, I am checking the factual accuracy of the student's answer relative to the ground truth answer. The ground truth states that female workers are entitled to 'one hour per day total' for nursing breaks, counted as working hours with no wage reduction. The student's answer mentions 'one or more daily breaks for breastfeeding' which are also counted as working hours with no wage reduction. While the student does not specify the exact duration of 'one hour per day total,' the mention of 'one or more daily breaks' does not contradict the ground truth and could imply a cumulative time that matches the one hour stated in the ground truth. The key point of being counted as working hours with no wage reduction is accurately reflected in the student's answer.\n\nSecond, I am checking for any conflicting statements within the student's answer. The student's response is consistent internally, stating that nursing breaks are in addition to regular rest periods and are part of working hours without wage reduction. There are no contradictions in the student's statement.\n\nThird, I am considering whether additional information provided by the student is acceptable. The student mentions that these breaks are 'in addition to the regular rest periods,' which is extra information not included in the ground truth. However, this additional detail does not conflict with the ground truth and is not factually inaccurate based on the provided information. As per the criteria, extra information is acceptable as long as it does not contradict the ground truth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the student's answer aligns with the ground truth on the critical points of nursing breaks being counted as working hours with no wage reduction. The lack of specificity regarding the exact duration ('one hour per day total') is not explicitly contradicted by the student's phrasing of 'one or more daily breaks,' and no conflicting statements are present. Therefore, I conclude that the student's answer meets the criteria for correctness."

The question asks specifically about the nursing break time female workers are entitled to. The student's answer directly addresses this by mentioning that female workers who are nursing are entitled to daily breaks for breastfeeding in addition to regular rest periods. The response is concise, sticking to the point without unnecessary details or tangents. Step 2: Determine if the answer helps to answer the question. The student provides relevant information about the entitlement to nursing breaks, specifies that these are in addition to regular breaks, and clarifies that these breaks are paid as they are counted as working hours. This directly answers the question about what nursing break time female workers are entitled to. Based on this analysis, the answer meets all criteria as it is both concise and relevant, and it effectively helps to answer the question."

The ground truth states that an employer must report material loss caused by a worker within 24 hours after becoming aware of the incident. The student's answer also states that the employer must report within 24 hours of becoming aware of the incident, which matches the ground truth perfectly in terms of the time frame and condition of awareness.\n\nSecond, I am ensuring there are no conflicting statements in the student's answer. The student's response does not present any information that contradicts the ground truth or itself. The mention of 'Saudi Labor Law' and 'competent authority' does not conflict with the core fact about the reporting time frame.\n\nThird, I am considering whether additional information in the student's answer is acceptable. The student includes extra context about the 'Saudi Labor Law' and reporting to the 'competent authority.' According to the criteria, additional information is acceptable as long as it does not conflict with the ground truth and remains factually accurate. Since the ground truth does not specify or contradict these additional details, and the core information matches, this extra information does not affect the correctness negatively.\n\nBased on this analysis, the student's answer meets all the criteria: it is factually accurate, contains no conflicting statements, and the additional information does not detract from its correctness relative to the ground truth."

      "question": "What is the training period requirement for work inspectors?",
      "rag_answer": "According to the Saudi Labor Law, work inspectors must undergo a training period as specified by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development. The law states that inspectors are required to complete a training program that qualifies them to perform inspection duties effectively, ensuring they are familiar with labor regulations, occupational safety, and inspection procedures before assuming their roles.",
      "ground_truth": "At least 90 days with conduct examination",
      "evaluations": {

          "score": false,
          "explanation": "Let's evaluate the student's answer step by step based on the provided criteria.\n\n1. **Factual Accuracy Relative to Ground Truth**: The ground truth answer specifies that work inspectors must undergo a training period of at least 90 days with a conduct examination. The student's answer mentions a training period as specified by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development and describes the purpose of the training (to qualify inspectors for duties, familiarity with regulations, safety, and procedures). However, the student's answer does not mention the specific duration of 'at least 90 days' or the requirement of a conduct examination. While it does not contradict the ground truth, it lacks the specific details provided in the ground truth answer. According to the grading criteria, the answer must be factually accurate relative to the ground truth, and missing key details like the duration and examination means it does not fully align with the ground truth.\n\n2. **No Conflicting Statements**: The student's answer does not contain any statements that conflict with the ground truth. It simply provides a broader description of the training requirement without contradicting the need for training or any other aspect of the ground truth.\n\n3. **Additional Information**: The student's answer includes extra information about the purpose of the training and the involvement of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development. As per the criteria, additional information is acceptable as long as it is factually accurate relative to the ground truth. However, since the core details (duration and conduct examination) are missing, the additional information does not compensate for the lack of specificity required to match the ground truth.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the student's answer does not conflict with the ground truth and provides relevant additional context, it fails to include the specific details of the training period being 'at least 90 days' and the requirement of a conduct examination. Therefore, it does not meet the criterion of factual accuracy relative to the ground truth answer. As a result, the answer cannot be considered fully correct under the given grading criteria."
